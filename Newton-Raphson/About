This is a MATLAB implementation of the generalized Newton-Raphson algorithm for solving a system of non-linear equations.

#Usage
1. The function takes in an integer (n) for the number of equations (or variables) and the corresponding equations need to be specified in the 'Fx' function as specified in the example.
2. Use X(1), X(2),... etc. for the varaibles in the equation.
